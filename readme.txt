= Woo to Erply =

This plugin is intended for users who have a fresh Erply account with no products on it.

Your WooCommerce store will be the single source of truth for your products. *Manage your products only in WooCommerce!* We highly recommend that you do not update product information in Erply nor add products directly to Erply. Doing so may result in WooCommerce and Erply becoming out of sync. A plugin is coming soon for Erply → Woo sync.

Use the plugin at your own risk. *Be sure to back up your database and files* before you run a sync.

= How to =

To begin using Erply with your WooCommerce store:
1. Install this plugin
2. Go to the plugin admin panel. For this, open “WooCommerce” in the left hand panel. Then, under “WooCommerce”, navigate to “Erply Integration”
3. Enter your credentials in the Preferences tab (if you do not yet have an account, contact our sales team here https://erply.com/contact-us/)
4. Choose whether if and how you want to sync all the new orders immediately. Also set general preferences used for all synchronizations - which product group to use, which warehouse to use and so on. Tooltips next to fields will guide you.
5. In the “Manual sync” tab, select which objects (products, orders or inventory amounts) to sync, and begin the process by clicking Synchronize. This may take a long time. If your site does not receive much traffic, you may find that refreshing any page on your site periodically will speed up the sync.
6. Whenever a new order is placed in your WooCommerce store, it will be immediately synced to your Erply account. Wonderful!

Whenever you add products, update price or anything else, be sure to run the sync (step 4) again to ensure your changes are synced to Erply.
